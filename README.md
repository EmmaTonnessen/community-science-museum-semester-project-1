Community Science Museum is a webpage for a museum I made as my first semester project at Noroff

## Description

This is one of the first projects I ever made. Initially, it only used plain CSS and HTML. Javascript has been added among a few other changes for my first-year portfolio. The text and images were handed out to me, but the design and code are all my own. It was a fun beginner project, and it was also fun to come back to it and change some things after I had learned more at the end of my first year.
