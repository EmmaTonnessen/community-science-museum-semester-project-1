                    <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic 
                    exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night 
                    sky and what we can see and know about the 
                    universe around us. We’ll locate the various 
                    constellations and galaxies that can be seen and 
                    learn a bit about the early navigators who used the 
                    stars to travel by. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
                    early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the 
                    latest exploration of the planets in our solar

                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have 
                    wrestled with the question of our origins. Where 
                    do we come from and how did we get here? Since 
                    Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have 
                    had a framework for exploring and understanding 
                    our place in this world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how 
                    the species we know today have evolved our time. 
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                    creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly 
                    Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs 
                    too</p>

                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
                    breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique 
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much 
                    longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                    thanks to the growth of our understanding of 
                    medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the 
                    history of medicine and take a look at some major 
                    'breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                    and the first heart transplant.  
                    </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have 
                    come not only from the lab, but also from 
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow 
                    creatures have beat us to it. </p>

                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans 
                    are having on the planet, the more important it 
                    becomes that scientists explore how to create a 
                    sustainable future not just for humans but for the 
                    whole planet. </p>
                    <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack 
                    the dangers we currently face including global 
                    warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But 
                    we also focus on the positive ways we can all 
                    contribute to a brighter future. </p>

                    <p>The information revolution is here and robotics 
                    and artificial intelligence are the science of the
